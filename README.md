# Credit Card Fraud Detection: A Comparative Analysis of Traditional Machine Learning and Neural Network Approaches

This project investigates methods for detecting credit card and mobile money fraud by comparing traditional machine learning models (XGBoost, Random Forest) with neural network architectures (MLPs). Using the highly imbalanced Kaggle European Credit Card Fraud dataset and the PaySim mobile money transaction dataset, the analysis focuses on:

- Model performance
- Class imbalance management
- Computational efficiency

### Research Questions
1. How do traditional machine learning models, such as XGBoost and Random Forest, compare with neural network architectures like Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) in detecting credit card and mobile money fraud?
2. How can class imbalance be effectively managed across both datasets to enhance model performance?
3. How do the complexity and computational efficiency (e.g., training time, inference speed) of traditional machine learning models compare to neural network architectures for fraud detection?

The project aims to provide insights into the effectiveness of these approaches for fraud detection. It is implemented using Python, with the following libraries:

- **scikit-learn** for traditional machine learning models
- **TensorFlow/Keras** for neural network models
- **pandas**, **numpy**, **matplotlib**, and **seaborn** for data manipulation and visualization
