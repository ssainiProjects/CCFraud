# European Credit Card Fraud Detection - Capstone Project

This project aims to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using the Kaggle European Credit Card Fraud dataset. As part of my capstone project, I will compare the performance of various traditional machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.) with deep learning approaches, including Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and Autoencoders.

**Project Features**:
- Dataset: [Kaggle European Credit Card Fraud Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)
- Algorithms: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, MLP, Autoencoders
- Comparative Analysis: Results will be compared with a similar study to evaluate the performance.

This repository will contain all the code, documentation, and results related to the project.
